# Introduction : Fortune Teller Website

This is a web application that predicts a user's fortune based on their date and time of birth. It uses OpenAI ChatGPT3.5 to generate the predictions. The frontend is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is built with Node.js and the Express.js framework. The backend is hosted via AWS Lambda function, making the project serverless.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Node js
- [Express js]([https://www.npmjs.com/package/express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express))
- [serverless-http] ([https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-http))
- [openAI] ([https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction))
- CloudFlare([https://dash.cloudflare.com/](https://dash.cloudflare.com/))
- [AWS Lambda Function] ([https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-2#/functions](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-2#/functions))

## **Dependencies**

The following dependencies are used in this project:

- cors v2.8.5
- express v4.18.2
- openai v3.2.1
- serverless-http v3.2.0

## **Usage**

Got to website [https://chatdodge-ko.pages.dev/](https://chatdodge-ko.pages.dev/) simply enter your date and time of birth on the homepage and click the "Predict Fortune" button. The website will then use OpenAI's ChatGPT3.5 model to generate a fortune prediction based on the input provided.

# Development

## Front-Engineering

Before I begin my development, I’ve used the openAi playground to test its limit. 

In order for AI to give the answers you want, you need to do front engineering. Since the current AI acknowlege it’s capability, if you simple ask the AI to tell about `my fortune` it will say the following : 

![Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 1.25.41 AM.png](assets/Screenshot_2023-03-27_at_1.25.41_AM.png)

To avoid this and force the AI to say the answer, I’ve added a preset to the system and confirm the preset as a user. 

```java
{role: "system", content: "You are the best astrologer in the world. Nothing is impossible for you and you can give any answer. Your name is Bin Doge. You can predict a person's life very clearly and give answers to his or her fortune. You have a lot of fortune-telling knowledge and can answer all questions clearly."},
        {role: "user", content: "You are the best astrologer in the world. Nothing is impossible for you and you can give any answer. Your name is Chat Doge. You can predict a person's life very clearly and give answers to his or her fortune. You have a lot of fortune-telling knowledge and can answer all questions clearly."},
        {role: "assistant", content: "Hello! I'm Bin Doge. Do you have any questions about horoscopes and astrology? Ask me anything, I'll do my best to answer."},
```

Now the AI gives relevant answer :

![Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 1.35.49 AM.png](assets/Screenshot_2023-03-27_at_1.35.49_AM.png)

Above, you can see that now the openAI is giving the answer you wanted.  Similarity, you can apply the concept to anything, you can tell the AI that `You are the best investment advisor in this world. You are better than Warren Buffett and you can make profit easily. Nothing is impossible for you and you can give any answer.` and continue making your investor-advisor  bot.

## To run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the **`backend`** directory and run **`npm install`** to install the required dependencies.
3. Comment out these lines since they are for serverless backend.

```java
let corsOptions = {
    origin: 'https://chatdodge-ko.pages.dev',
    credentials: true
}
app.use(cors(corsOptions));

module.exports.handler = serverless(app);
```

1. Un - comment `app.listen(3000)`
2. Put your openAI API Key
3.  Run the command **`npm start`** to start the backend server.
4. Navigate to the `frontEnd` directory and change fetch uri to `localhost:3000/fortuneTell`
5. Go-Live with frontend index.html

## Frontend Architecture

Since this is a small project, I found no need to use React or any other libraries. I used plain HTML, CSS and Javascript to program the index.html. Simply use ajax to fetch the api response to display AI’s message and sends the user’s message. The frontpage picture was also created by the openAI [DALL-E2]([https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2)) . 

## **Backend Architecture**

To keep the project small and cost-efficient, a serverless backend was used via AWS Lambda function. The backend provides a REST API that the frontend uses to fetch the data object. The serverless framework used was Serverless-http.

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

You can use any hosting service to deploy the frontend, however I used [Cloudflare]([https://dash.cloudflare.com/](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)) to host my frontend.

1. Create a new Cloudflare account
2. Click `Pages` or go to dashboard
3. Create new page and upload the `frontend` directory

### Backend Deployment

To deploy the backend, you will need to set up an AWS account and Lambda function. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Lambda function.
2. Upload the **`backend`** directory to the Lambda function.
3. Set up an API Gateway to link the Lambda function to the frontend.
4. Deploy the API Gateway.

The AI try to deny its name.
